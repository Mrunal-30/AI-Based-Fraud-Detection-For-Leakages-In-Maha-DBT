# AI-Based-Fraud-Detection-For-Leakages-In-Maha-DBT

This project aims to detect fraudulent activities and leakages in the MahaDBT (Maharashtra Direct Benefit Transfer) system using machine learning. The solution leverages a Random Forest classifier to predict the likelihood of fraud based on various input features, such as requested amount, Aadhaar number, and suspicious activities, which helps improve the efficiency and transparency of government schemes. The project is built with a Flask backend API to handle data processing and machine learning predictions and a React-based frontend for an interactive user interface. Tailwind CSS is used for modern styling to make the interface responsive and user-friendly. The backend integrates a pre-trained RandomForestClassifier model that provides real-time fraud probability predictions based on the inputs.

To get started with this project, you need to first clone the repository, install dependencies for both the backend and frontend, and then run the backend API (Flask) followed by the frontend (React). The backend API is responsible for processing inputs and predicting fraud, while the frontend provides an interactive form for users to input details such as requested amount, Aadhaar number, multiple claims, suspicious activity, and more. The Flask API endpoint accepts a POST request with the necessary data and returns a fraud probability score. The frontend, built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS, communicates with the backend and displays the results in a user-friendly manner.

This project is designed to help streamline fraud detection in government schemes like MahaDBT and can be expanded to incorporate other schemes or integrated into larger systems for automated fraud prevention. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or suggest improvements to the model. The machine learning model used is a RandomForestClassifier trained on data from the MahaDBT system, which processes various features to predict fraudulent activities. The modelâ€™s accuracy can be improved over time by retraining it with additional data and enhancing the features.

The project can be easily set up and run locally, with clear steps provided for installation and usage. Contributions are welcome to improve this system and extend it to handle more complex fraud detection scenarios.
